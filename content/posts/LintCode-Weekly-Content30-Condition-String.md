I ran into the "Condition String" in weekly contest of LintCode and failed to solve it. After spending some time on it after the contest ended, I found that the first idea I came up with was wrong. Here comes my writeup.

## Problem Description
Here I would give the screenshot of challenge:  
![](../../static/10-31-20/description.png)

## First solution [Fail]
First, I tried to handle this problem with **longest increase subarray**. For example, in `acec`  
with start point from `a`, it would move forward until `e` and get the max length of 3.  
with start point from `c`, it would move forward until `e` and get the max length of 2.
However, after the contest ended, I found this idea was totally wrong. With this idea, we cannot find the case of `acc` because we also can remove the character of `e` to get the longest string. Therefore, we cannot handle this problem with longest increase subarray.

## Final solution with DP
We need a DP array to memorize the current max length ending with three kinds of characters. Why this method can get the all possible cases of longest subsequence? Let me show the sample in following:  
```cpp
// dp[i]: the max length end with i
// here i would only be 0, 1, 2 which represent a,c,e or b,d,f
// take the same example 'acec' and iterate through
dp[i]    a     c     e
x        0     0     0
str[0]   1     0     0     // updated with 'a'
str[1]   1     2     0     // updated with 'ac'
str[2]   1     2     3     // e updated with 'ace', c stay still with 'ac'
str[3]   1     3     3     // c updated with 'acc', e stay still with 'ace'
```
From this example, now I can give the answer to the question. This method works because he can memorize the previous status which ends with different tails. So let's come back to the example, if `str[3]` was 'a', we can still attach it to the `dp[0]` and check whether `aa` can be our condition string of max length or not. Great, now let us move to the solution:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param s: a string only contains `a-f`
     * @return: The longest length that satisfies the condition
     */
    int check(vector<int> &s) {
        vector<int> dp(3, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            int c = s[i];
            
            int last = INT_MIN;
            for(int j = 0; j <= c; j++) {
                last = max(last, dp[j] + 1);
            } 
            dp[c] = last;
        }
        
        return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    } 
    
    int conditionString(string &s) {
        // write your code here
        if(s.size() == 1)
            return 1;
            
        vector<int> ace;
        vector<int> bdf;
        for(auto c : s) {
            if(c == 'a') {
                ace.push_back(0);
            }else if(c == 'b') {
                bdf.push_back(0);
            }else if(c == 'c') {
                ace.push_back(1);
            }else if(c == 'd') {
                bdf.push_back(1);
            }else if(c == 'e') {
                ace.push_back(2);
            }else {
                bdf.push_back(2);
            }
        }
        
        return check(ace) + check(bdf);
    }
};
```
I have explained for the part of `check()`, in main function part, we just need to separate the string to two groups and handle with function individually.

## Conclusion
At first, this challenge is categorized to the hard level; however, down-leveled to medium one at the end. Well, this problem is not that hard as well. The key point is to come up with **definition of DP**: the max length ending with different characters.
