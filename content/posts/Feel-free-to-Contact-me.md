Nice to meet you, I am Rafael.

## So...
In this blog, I would record my learning process including **Algorithm**, **writeup of OJ**, **System Design**, **Notes of Machine Learning/Deep Learning**, **Some myths I always mistake for** and so on. You can search tags to find what you want. I would use my home language - which is Chinese to make the notes. Of course, if you are interested in specific articles, I am happy to translate for you in my free time. You can leave your email and the article you want for translation in following comment. Or you can also contact me with my email: shinmaox2016@gmail.com

Feel free to contact me :)
